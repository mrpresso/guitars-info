        <h1>History of Guitars</h1>
        <p>The guitar is one of the most popular and versatile instruments in the world. Its history goes back thousands of years, influenced by many cultures and different kinds of early stringed instruments.</p>
        
        <h2>Ancient Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Early guitar-like instruments existed thousands of years ago. Ancient Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Persians used instruments that looked similar to today’s guitar. These early instruments, like the **Egyptian "nefer"** and **Mesopotamian "pantur,"** helped shape the guitar we know today.</p>
    
        <h2>Influence from Spain and Europe</h2>
        <p>The guitar as we know it started to take shape in Spain. It was influenced by the **oud** (an instrument brought to Spain by the Moors in the 8th century) and the **vihuela** (an early Spanish instrument). By the 15th century, these instruments were becoming more popular in Europe, laying the groundwork for the guitar.</p>
    
        <h2>The Role of the Lute</h2>
        <p>In medieval Europe, the **lute** became very popular. Its shape and strings influenced the design of the guitar, even though the lute itself was eventually replaced by simpler guitar designs.</p>
    
        <h2>The Classical Guitar (18th - 19th Century)</h2>
        <p>By the 18th century, the guitar began to look more like it does today. Spanish makers, like **Antonio de Torres Jurado**, helped standardize the guitar’s body shape and size, which led to the "classical guitar." This design is still used in many modern acoustic guitars.</p>
    
        <h2>The Electric Guitar Revolution (20th Century)</h2>
        <p>In the 1930s, inventors like **George Beauchamp** and **Les Paul** created the electric guitar. This allowed guitars to be louder and stand out in jazz, rock, and blues music. Electric guitars quickly became essential in popular music, changing the sound of modern music forever.</p>
    
        <h2>Guitars Today</h2>
        <p>Today, there are many types of guitars: acoustic, electric, classical, steel-string, and more. Each type has unique qualities that suit different kinds of music. The guitar has come a long way, shaped by many cultures and musical styles, and is loved worldwide.</p>
